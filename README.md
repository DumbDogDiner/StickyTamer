# Tamer ðŸ¦Š

### **This project is still WIP!**

Tamer is a plugin for [`PaperMC`](https://github.com/papermc/paper) (1.14 - 1.16.3), which not only allows players to 
protect their entities from other players, but also enhances the vanilla entity taming/breeding mechanics!

# Features
* **Lightweight & fast** entity claiming plugin
* **Easy & innovative** entity taming/breeding mechanics
* **Absolutely no** dependencies  
* **Optional** PlaceholderAPI support


# Installation 

Due to this plugin depending on private APIs, it is currently not possible to compile it from source. This might change in the future.

**There are no publicly available releases at the moment!**

# Planned Features

* **Add support** for 1.8 - 1.13
* **Custom** entity attributes & 'spells'
